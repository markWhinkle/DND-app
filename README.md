# DND-app
The file for DND APP is currently a work in progress for about a week. So far, I am working on having the app recognize command issued by user. The command issued must be 
discerned from either being a command word for some in program use or an external call to the DnD beyond official API that can return information on things regarding DnD. I am 
developing this app because I have recently found a great interest in DnD and I wanted to use my skills to develop something that could be used when I play and could 
be used by others. I have plans in making this either a standalone app or a website, or perhaps both.
